# Cplusplus-Program

This app tracks all produce sold. it lists all types of produce sold, starting with the fist sale. It has three options to choose from; it can give you the list of items sold with the amount that was sold, it can give you the amount of a specific produce item sold, and it can list all items sold with the amount as well as with a histogram of items sold.

An area that I did really well, I belive is the combining what could have been two functions into one for simplicity. Instead of making to separate funtions, one to list the produce with total count and another to list all produce with total count and a histogram. Instead I combined them and made it so that the output was diffrent depending on the users input. 

One area I feel I could improve on is the main function in the C++ file. I feel like I could clean it up more and maybe put a lot of that in it's own fuction to sorten the main function for simplicity, I just couldn't figure out how to do it easliy with the time I had to work on the project.

The hardest part for me was just getting the Python file to work with C++. I struggled in figuring out how to get it to work properly, but after struggling with it for a while I was able to get it and also feel like I had a better understanting of how Python works with C++, I mostly used the resourses provided in the course and StackOverflow to try and figure out what was going wrong.

Skills that would be transfurable to other projects from this one would definitly include how to use multipul languages. Also C++ in genereal is a good lanugae to have some knolage about it seems, as well as this project along with other project in the class helped me get a better understanding of flowcharts, otherclasses seemed to glaze overthem and never said anything about my work, so I didn't even know I was doing it wrong until this class.

I made this program readable by making function names and veriable names discriptive and unique, as well as utalizing the standards for the project and specifing private veriables and such. I also added inline comments to the code to describe each funtion and how it works. This will also help with maintainablitly and adabtablitly because well documented code is easier to understand and change without issues then one that is has no discriptions, comments, or lack of readablity.
